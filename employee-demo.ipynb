This is a good-old-fashioned relational query with an index. It's wicked fast and showcases exactly why we have indexes in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second query is the graph query (notice the `->` symbols). That operation is **Iterate Value** on the `member` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The query works by tracing edges held in the **gotFeedback** table. By tracing the edges to the appropriate records in the **feedback** table, we neither had to iterate over the table nor build an index to make that iteration faster.\n",
    "\n",
